# Project Report: Continuous Control - DDPG DRL algorithm 

### Introduction

For this project, an intelligence agent is trained to control a double-joined arm to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible. After training for only 12 episode, the average score of the 20 agents reaches above 30.
